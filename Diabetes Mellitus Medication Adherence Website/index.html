          <h4>WHAT IS DIABETES?</h4>
          <p><strong>Diabetes Mellitus</strong> is a long-term condition where the body (particularly the pancreas) has trouble controlling blood sugar (glucose) levels.
            The main types are:
            <br/>
            <strong>Type 1 Diabetes:</strong> The body stops producing insulin completely and has no means to reduce the sugar levels in the blood.
            <br>
            <strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> The body becomes resistant to insulin or makes too little of it.
            <br>
            <strong>Gestational Diabetes:</strong> High  blood sugar occurring when hormonal changes during pregnancy make the body less able to use insulin effectively.

          <h4>WHAT CAUSES DIABETES?</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)</strong> is a genetic <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21624-autoimmune-diseases">autoimmune disease</a> in which your immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas for unknown reasons and can happen at any age
            <br/>
            <strong>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)</strong> is due to a combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency brought about by obesity, aging, and a sedentary lifestyle.

            <br/>
            <strong><a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9012-gestational-diabetes">Gestational Diabetes (GDM)</a></strong> occurs when your body cannot make enough insulin during pregnancy, making glucose stay in the blood.

        <h4 class="adherence__definition">WHAT IS ADHERENCE?</h4>
        <p>
          Medication adherence means taking your diabetes medications exactly as prescribed; at the correct dose, at the right times, in the right way, and for the full duration recommended by your healthcare provider. This includes insulin, oral antidiabetic drugs, and any other prescribed medications related to your condition.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h4 class="adherence__definition">WHY IS ADHERENCE IMPORTANT?</h4>
        <ul class="adherence__importance">
          <li><strong>Keeps your blood sugar under control:</strong> Taking your medications consistently helps maintain stable blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of both high and low blood sugar episodes</li>
          <li><strong>Prevents complications:</strong> Proper adherence reduces the risk of diabetes-related complications such as heart attacks, kidney damage, vision loss, and strokes.</li>
          <li><strong>Improves quality of life:</strong>When your blood sugar is well-controlled, you are less likely to experience fatigue, frequent urination, excessive thirst, or other disruptive symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Saves money and reduces hospital visits:</strong> Preventing complications lowers healthcare costs.</li>

        <h4 class="adherence__definition">WHAT ARE THE DANGERS OF NON-ADHERENCE?</h4>
        <ul class="non-adherence__dangers">
          <li><strong>Risk of High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycaemia):</strong>Missing doses can cause blood sugar to rise, leading to fatigue, frequent urination, blurred vision, and increased thirst.</li>

          <li><strong>Severe Complications: </strong>Frequently missing taking your medication increases the risk of long-term problems such as kidney failure, nerve damage, heart attacks, strokes, and vision problems. </li>

          <li><strong>Risk of Low blood Sugar (Hypoglycaemia): </strong>Especially in the case of insulin, if you take your medication but skip a meal, eat less than usual, or take your doses at irregular times, your blood sugar can drop too low. This can make you feel shaky, dizzy, sweaty, or very hungry. In severe cases, it can cause confusion, fainting, or even a medical emergency. </li>

          <li><strong>Impact on mental & emotional health: </strong>When blood sugar levels fluctuate because of missed or irregular doses, it can make you feel physically unwell—tired, irritable, or shaky. Over time, these physical ups and downs can also affect your mood and emotions and experience frustration, anxiety, or stress when they feel like their condition is “out of control.” and affect your sleep.</li>

        <div class="faq__answer">

            <h4>Practical Daily Tips</h4>
            <p>These are meant to help you build habits and reduce forgetfulness.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Use pillboxes or medication organizers:</strong> Label each compartment with the day and time of your dose. This visual cue helps prevent missed or double doses and makes it easy to see whether you’ve taken your medication for the day.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Link medication to daily routines:</strong>Take your medicine after brushing your teeth, during breakfast, or before bedtime. Pairing medication with a routine you already follow helps make taking it automatic and less likely to be forgotten.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Simplify your schedule:</strong> Talk to your healthcare provider about switching to once-daily medications or combination pills if possible. Fewer doses mean less chance of missing medication and easier management overall.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Keep a medication journal:</strong> Writing down each dose you take, along with blood sugar readings, can help you notice patterns, avoid missed doses, and discuss your progress with your healthcare provider.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Reward yourself for consistency:</strong> Celebrate small wins, like completing a week without missed doses. Positive reinforcement can help turn medication-taking into a lasting habit.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <!--Strategy 2, Row 2: Text Left-->

          <div class="strategy__text">
            <h4>Technology Aids</h4>
            <p>Digital tools make it easier to remember doses and stay consistent.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Medication reminder apps: </strong>Apps like Medisafe, MyTherapy, and Dosecast send alerts when it’s time to take your medicine. They can also track doses, remind you to refill prescriptions, and even keep a log of your blood sugar readings, helping you and your healthcare provider monitor your progress</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>SMS or WhatsApp alerts:</strong> Inquire with your clinics or pharmacies about sending messages to remind you about upcoming doses or prescription refills. These simple alerts can be a helpful nudge to prevent missed doses.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Smart pill bottles or watches</strong>: These devices record when you take your medication and can notify you or a caregiver if a dose is missed. They are especially useful for people who take multiple medications or have a busy schedule.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Blood sugar monitoring devices with app integration:</strong> Some glucose meters and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) sync with apps to track trends over time. Seeing your results can motivate you to stick to medication schedules and lifestyle recommendations.</li>
            </ul>
            </ul>

            <br/>
            <h4>Social & Support Based Strategies</h4>
            <p>Having a support system increases accountability and motivation.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Involve family members or caregivers:</strong> Ask someone you trust to remind you to take your medication, help organize doses, or simply offer encouragement. Having support at home can make adherence less stressful and more consistent.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Join support groups:</strong> Connecting with others who are managing diabetes, either in person or online, allows you to share experiences, tips, and encouragement. Knowing that others face similar challenges can boost motivation and provide practical strategies for staying on track.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Engage in patient education programs:</strong> Attend workshops or seminars offered by clinics or diabetes organizations. Learning more about your condition with others can improve confidence in self-management and adherence.</li>
              <br/>

              <li><strong>Buddy system:</strong> Pair up with a friend or fellow patient to check in on each other’s medication routines. This adds accountability and makes managing diabetes feel less isolating.</li>
